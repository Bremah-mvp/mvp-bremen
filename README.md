# Responsive-Portfolio
This is a website application that prescribes and clarifies my expertise, skills and qualifications
attached to my designated carrier.

                          EARLY STEPS
  I had to create a listing and sketch of how i wanted my application to be presented. collecting 
  of all the necessary data i need and correspond them to years tied to spwcific data.

                         TOOLS USED TO CREATE MY WEB APP.

HTML 
It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser I used html to design the structure or the first layout of the application

CSS 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. I used css to add styles and coloring to make the application more attractive.

BOOTSTRAP 
One of the most import aspects of bootstrap it enables a Mobile First design. Using the BootStrap framework helps make the design and final product a mobile friendly app from the beginning. I used bootstrap to add more styles to the layout so the app can be even more atrractive and flexible. 

                        How IT WORKS
